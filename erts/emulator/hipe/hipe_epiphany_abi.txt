HiPE Epiphany ABI
============
This document describes aspects of HiPE's runtime system that are specific to
the Epiphany architecture.

Register Usage
--------------
sp and r28-r31 are reserved for the C runtime system.

r6, r7, and r32 are fixed (unallocatable).
r6 (NSP) is the current process' native stack pointer.
r7 (HP) is the current process' heap pointer.
r32 (P) is the current process' "Process" pointer.

r0-r5, r8-r12, r14 (lr), r15-r27, r33-r63 are caller-save. They are used as
temporary scratch registers and for function call parameters and results.

The runtime system uses temporaries in specific contexts:
r8 (TEMP_LR) is used to preserve lr around BIF calls,
and to pass the callee address in native-to-BEAM traps.
r9 (TEMP_ARG0) is used to preserve the return value in nbif_stack_trap_ra,
and lr in hipe_epiphany_inc_stack (the caller saved its lr in TEMP_LR).

Calling Convention
------------------
The first NR_ARG_REGS parameters (a tunable parameter between 0 and 8,
inclusive) are passed in r1-r5,r16-r18.

r14 contains the return address during function calls.

The first NR_RET_REGS return values (a tunable parameter between 0 and 4,
inclusive) are placed in r0-r3.

ARITHMODE shall be set to 0b100 (signed integer) on function entry and exit.

Stack Frame Layout
------------------
[From top to bottom: formals in left-to-right order, incoming return
address, fixed-size chunk for locals & spills, variable-size area
for actuals, outgoing return address. NSP normally points at the
bottom of the fixed-size chunk, except during a recursive call.
The callee pops the actuals, so no NSP adjustment at return.]

Notes:
 - If we were to enforce a double-word alignment of the stack pointer at all
   times, that might allow us to use the double-word memory ops, making the code
   more compact.

Stack Descriptors
-----------------
sdesc_fsize() is the frame size excluding the return address word.

Epiphany SDK Calling Conventions
================================

Reg		Status		Role
---		------		----
r0-r3           calleR-save     Argument/result/scratch registers.
r4-r10          calleE-save     Local variables.
r11             calleE-save     (fp) Local variable or frame pointer.
r12             calleR-save     "Intra-procedure call scratch register"
r13             fixed           (sp) Stack pointer. Must be 4-byte aligned at
                                all times.
r14             calleE-save     (lr) Link register or local variable.
r15             calleE-save     Local variable.
r16-r27         calleR-save     Scratch registers.
r28-r31         fixed           "Reserved for constants"
r32-r43         calleE-save     Local variables.
r44-r63         calleR-save     Scratch registers.

The stack grows from high to low addresses. A process may only access (for
reading or writing) the closed interval of the entire stack delimited by
[SP, (stack-base - 1)]. Stack frames must be double-word aligned.

ARITHMODE is calleE-save.
